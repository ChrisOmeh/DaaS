Azure Database for PostgreSQL
QUESTION:
Is it possible that there is potential data loss at point of cut over? Imagine a scenario where cut over takes me 1
0secs to complete and within this 10secs, there is a transaction recorded in my source database. 
Thus, leading to potential loss of that transaction to destination database(Azure db for MySql). Thanks

ANSWER:
Usually, in an online migration, before you perform the cutover, you wait for any pending transactions to be applied to the target. 
Once you initiate the cutover, any incoming transaction to the source are stopped for that duration.
