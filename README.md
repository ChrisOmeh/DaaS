*Breakdown of Monthly dues payment since May we started.*
Total number of people paid = 10
Total Amount paid = #20,700.00k

Percentage of those that have completed this year monthly dues from may we started  = 50% of those that have paid.

Percentage of those yet to complete this years dues = 50% of those that have paid.

Percentage of those that have made upfront payment toward next year = 30% of those that have paid.

A completion of this year(2022) dues means paying 2,400 Naira which is #300 * 8months counting from May 2022 we started paying monthly
dues.

As we all know, it is what we reliazed from monthly dues that will help us undergo the project we have at hand.

In a special way i want to appreciated those that have completed their this year payment and have even made upward/upfront payment into 
next year. May God continue to bless us all. 

If you are yet to make any commitment/pay pls try and do so. We undertstand that times are hard but i believe we can do this.

If 50% of people in this group should make their payments, we will have enough to do our project.
