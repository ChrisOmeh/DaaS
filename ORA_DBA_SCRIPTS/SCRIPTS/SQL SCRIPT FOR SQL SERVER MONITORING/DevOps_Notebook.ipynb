    "# Introduction to Deployment Patterns\n",
    "## Explore Microservices Architecture\n",
    "Microservices are a word that is commonly heard nowadays. A microservice is a software component that is self-contained, deployable independently, and scalable.They're tiny, focused on doing one thing well, and can operate independently. If one microservice changes, it should have no effect on the other microservices in your landscape.By using a microservices architecture, you will be able to construct a landscape of services that can be built, tested, and deployed independently. It indicates additional dangers and complexities.It would be ideal if you established a database to track interfaces and how they interact with one another. In addition, you must manage numerous application lifecycles rather than just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/39cd157bd8251641f000\n",
    "A multi-layer design is common in conventional applications.One layer has the user interface, another contains the business logic and services, and a third contains the data services.There are sometimes separate teams for the user interface and the backend. When anything needs to be changed, it must be changed at all levels.When transitioning to a microservices architecture, all of these levels become part of the same microservice.Only one function is provided by the microservice.The interaction between the microservices occurs asynchronously.They do not communicate directly with one another but instead employ asynchronous techniques such as queues or events.Each microservice has its own lifetime and pipeline for Continuous Delivery. If they were properly developed, you could deploy new microservice versions without affecting other portions of the system.Although the microservice design is not required for Continuous Delivery, smaller software components do aid in the implementation of a fully automated pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examine Classical Deployment Patterns\n",
    "When we have all of the requirements in place to supply our software on a continuous basis, we can begin to consider a deployment pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, a deployment pattern was simple.\n",
    "The software was developed, and after all features were complete, it was deployed in an environment where a group of people could begin using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conventional or classical deployment approach was to move your program via development, testing, acceptance or staging, and eventually production.\n",
    "\n",
    "The software progressed through the phases as a single unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, the production release was a Big Bang release, in which consumers were presented with several changes at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the several levels of testing and validation, this approach is fraught with danger.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running all of your testing and validation in non-production settings makes it difficult to forecast what will happen when your production users begin using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may do load testing and availability tests, but nothing beats production in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understand Modern Deployment Patterns\n",
    "End users always utilize your program in a unique way. Unexpected events will occur in a data center, and numerous events from various users will cooccur, activating code that has not been tested in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we must accept that some features can only be tested in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing in production may seem intimidating, but it should not be.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw that it is feasible to deploy features without exposing them to all users when we discussed splitting our functional and technical releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can test our software in production by combining this notion of feature toggling with our deployment procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Canary releases.\n",
    "* Dark launching.\n",
    "* Blue-green deployments.\n",
    "* Progressive exposure or ring-based deployment.\n",
    "* Feature toggles.\n",
    "* A/B testing.\n",
    "* Take a critical look at your architecture\n",
    "* Is your architecture and present software state ready for Continuous Delivery?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wish to think about the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is your software built as a single massive monolith or in numerous components?\n",
    "* Can you supply individual components of your application?\n",
    "* Can you ensure the quality of your software when it is deployed many times each week?\n",
    "* How do you put your software through its paces?\n",
    "* Do you have one or more versions of your software running?\n",
    "* Can different versions of your software operate concurrently?\n",
    "* What has to be improved in order to deploy Continuous Delivery?\n",

    "# Implement Blue-Green Deployment and Feature Toggles\n",
    "\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/bb6c157bdaacb541f000\n",
    "\n",
    "By running two identical environments, blue-green deployment decreases risk and downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are known as blue and green habitats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one of the environments is operational, with the operational environment handling all production traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, blue is now live, whereas green is idle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you prepare a new version of your software, the deployment and final testing stages take place in a non-live environment, in this case, green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the software has been deployed and extensively tested in green, switch the router or load balancer so that all incoming requests go to green rather than blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Green is currently active, whereas blue is idle. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method can reduce downtime caused by app deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, blue-green deployment decreases risk: if something unexpected happens with your new version on green, you can quickly roll back to the previous version by switching back to blue.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is complicated when it comes to database schema updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "You most likely cannot swap your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that situation, your application and architecture should be designed to support both the old and new database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore Deployment Slots\n",
    "Blue-green deployments are quite simple when using a cloud platform like Azure.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are not required to create code or set up infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using web apps, you may take use of a built-in functionality known as deployment slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure App Service includes deployment slots. They are active applications with hostnames.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make many slots for your application (for example, Dev, Test, or Stage).\n",
    "\n",
    "The production slot is where your live app will remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may evaluate app changes in staging before exchanging them with your production slot using deployment slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use a deployment slot to build up a new version of your application and then switch the production environment for the new staging environment when you're through.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is accomplished by an internal switching of the IP addresses of both slots.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercise - set up a Blue–green Deployment\n",
    "You will study Blue-Green Deployment in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "Let's take a look at how a release pipeline may help you implement blue-green deployments.\n",
    "We'll begin by developing a new project with a release process capable of redeploying the Parts Unlimited template.\n",
    "An initial app deployment\n",
    "In a browser, navigate to Azure DevOps Demo Generator: https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/ and click Sign in.\n",
    "If required, you will be requested to sign in.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Select your current Organization in the Create New Project box, change the Project Name to PU Hosted, and then click Choose template.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click the PartsUnlimited project (not the PartsUnlimited-YAML project), then select Create Project. When the deployment is finished, click Navigate to Project.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To begin a build, go to the PU Hosted main menu and select Pipelines, then clicks Builds, then Queue, and finally Run.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click Releases from the main menu. A release was attempted because a continuous integration trigger was in place. However, because we have not yet setup the release, it will fail. To enter edit mode for the release, click Edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Pick the Dev stage from the Tasks drop-down menu, then click to select the Azure Deployment task.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Select your Azure subscription in the Azure resource group deployment window, then click Authorize when required. After permission is complete, select a location for the web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In the job list, click Azure App Service Deploy to see its settings. Select your Azure subscription once again. Staging should be selected as the Deployment slot.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Click Dev in the task list, and then pick Azure Pipelines for the Agent pool and vs2017-win2016 for the Agent Specification in the Agent job window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Click Dev in the task list, and then pick Azure Pipelines for the Agent pool and vs2017-win2016 for the Agent Specification in the Agent job window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. When the Clone icon appears, hover over the Green Site stage and click it. Change the name of the stage to Production. Select Production from the Tasks drop-down menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Click Azure App Service deploy task and Uncheck the Deploy to slot option Save and then OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The production site has not been assigned to a deployment slot. It has been deployed to the primary location.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. To make a new release, click Create release, then Create. When it's finished, click the release link to see how it's doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment should be successful after some time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the green site and the production site\n",
    "14. In the Azure portal, navigate to the blade for the ASPDOTNET resource group generated by the project deployment. Take note of the names of the deployed web applications. To open the blade of the Staging* web app, click. Copy the URL from the upper left corner.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Navigate to the copied URL in a new browser tab. The application will take a few moments to compile, but then the Green website (on the Staging slot) should display.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Open another fresh browser tab and visit to the same URL but without the -staging slot. The manufacturing location should also be operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure blue-green swap and approval\n",
    "Now that both sites are operational, we can set up the release process for blue-green deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. To return to edit mode in Azure DevOps, click Pipelines, then Releases, then Edit in the main menu for the PU Hosted project.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. To delete the Production stage, click Delete, then Agree. To add an extra stage, click +Add, and for the template, pick Empty job. Set the Stage name to Swap Blue-Green.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "19. Click Variables and change the Scope of WebsiteName to Release.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. Select the Swap Blue-Green stage from the Tasks drop-down list. To add a new assignment, click the Add button on the right-hand side of Agent Job. Enter CLI in the Search box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "21. Hover over the Azure CLI template and click the Add button when it appears, then click to choose the Azure CLI job to open its options pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Configure the pane as follows, using your subscription, Inline Script: and Script Location of Inline Script\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Click Pipeline from the menu above the job list. Click the Pre-deployment conditions icon for the Swap Blue-Green stage, then activate Pre-deployment approvals in the Triggers pane.\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Set yourself up as an approver, then click Save and OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the blue-green swap\n",
    "\n",
    "25. Click Repos on the PU Hosted main menu, then click Files to open the project files. Go to the following file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll make a cosmetic tweak to ensure that the website is updated. To target an international audience, we'll alter the term tires in the main page rotation to tyres.\n",
    "\n",
    "26. Click Edit to allow editing, then replace the tires with the word tyres. Click Commit and Commit to preserve the modifications and start the build and release process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "27. Click Pipelines, then Builds, from the main menu. Allow the continuous integration build to finish successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "28. Click Releases from the main menu. Click here to view the most recent release (at the top of the list).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now being asked to approve the deployment switch from Development to Production. We'll start with the green deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "29. Refresh the Green site (Staging slot) browser tab to determine if your update has taken effect. It now displays the modified term.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "30. Refresh the Production site browser tab to see whether it has been updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "31. When you're satisfied with the modifications, click Approve, then Approve and wait for the step to finish.\n",

    "## Introduction to Feature Toggles\n",
    "Using Feature Flags, you may modify how our system operates without making major modifications to the code. A little configuration adjustment is necessary. In many circumstances, it will also be limited to a small number of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Flags provide an alternative to pushing new code into the trunk and deploying it, however it is not yet functioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "They're typically employed to regulate conditional logic as the values of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume your team is all working on a financial application's primary trunk branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've concluded that it's worth attempting to complete all of the work in the main branch to prevent complicated merging procedures later.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you must guarantee that large modifications to the interest computations are possible, as users rely on that code every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Worse, the modifications will take weeks to complete. You cannot leave the main code broken during that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Feature Flag might assist you in getting around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can modify the code so that other users who do not have the Feature Flag set will use the default interest calculation code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new interest calculation code will be available to members of your team who are working on the new interest calculations and are configured to view the Feature Flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an example of a business feature flag that may be used to identify business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Release Flag is the other sort of Feature Flag. Assume that when you finish working on the interest calculation code, you are concerned about releasing a new code to all users at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have a set of users who are better at dealing with new code and difficulties as they occur, and they are sometimes referred to as Canaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name is derived from the Canaries' traditional usage in coal mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "You modify the setup such that the Canary users have the Feature Flag set as well, and they begin testing the new code as well. If issues arise, you may immediately disable the flag for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For AB testing, another release flag might be utilized. Maybe you'd want to know if a new feature makes it easier for people to perform a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have half of the users working with the original code and the other half working with the updated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may then compare the results and decide if the feature is worthwhile to keep. Feature Flags are also known as Feature Toggles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may deploy new software without revealing any new or updated functionality to the end-user by just \"flipping a switch\" during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is which technique you wish to employ when deploying a feature to an end-user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reveal the feature to a subset of people to gauge how the new feature is accepted and used.\n",
    "Reveal the functionality to a randomly selected fraction of users.\n",
    "Reveal the feature to all users at the same time.\n",
    "The business owner is critical to the process, and you must collaborate closely with them to select the best plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important component of any deployment pattern, as noted in the beginning, is continually looking at how the system behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of separating feature deployment from feature exposure is appealing, and we want to use it in our Continuous Delivery process.\n",
    "\n",
    "It helps us with  stable releases and better options to roll back when we encounter problems with a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "We turn it off again and then build a hotfix. By separating deployments from disclosing a feature, you provide the possibility of releasing a day at any moment because the new software will not influence the system that is currently operational.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are Feature Toggles?\n",
    "Feature toggles can also be referred to as feature flippers, feature flags, feature switches, conditional features, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from the business power they provide you, they also give you a development edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature toggles are an excellent alternative to branching. Branching is what our version control system does.\n",
    "\n",
    "We keep a distinct branch to keep features separate.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we are ready to put the software into production, we merge it with the release branch and deploy it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You create new features by hiding them behind a toggle with feature toggles. When a release happens, your feature is \"off\" and should not be exposed to or influence the production program.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Implement a Feature Toggle\n",
    "A feature toggle is just an IF statement in its most basic form.\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/7b8c157be04e6e01f000\n",
    "\n",
    "When the switch is turned off, the code in the IF is executed; otherwise, the code in the ELSE is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make it more smarter by managing feature toggles from a dashboard or creating capabilities for roles, users, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many alternative frameworks are available commercially as Open Source if you wish to add feature toggles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Describe Feature Toggle Maintenance\n",
    "A feature toggle is nothing more than code. And, more specifically, conditional code. It complicates the code and raises technical debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep that in mind as you write them, and tidy up when you're done with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "While feature flags might be useful, they can also present a slew of new problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept behind a toggle is that it is temporary and only remains in the program when it is essential to distribute it to consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martin Fowler describes two dimensions for classifying toggles.\n",
    "\n",
    "He claims that you may consider how lengthy a toggle should be in your codebase and how dynamic the toggle should be.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lifecycle of a feature flag planning\n",
    "\n",
    "Planning feature flag lifecycles\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/e062157be09ff681f000\n",
    "\n",
    "The most essential thing to remember is that the toggles must be removed from the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't, they'll accumulate technical debt if you keep them around for too long.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've increased your total technical debt as soon as you add a feature flag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using feature flags can make your code less solid and introduce the following issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code becomes more difficult to test efficiently as the number of logical combinations grows.\n",
    "Because the code is more complicated, it is more difficult to maintain.\n",
    "The code might be considerably less safe.\n",
    "When difficulties are discovered, it might be more difficult to replicate them.\n",
    "It is vital to have a plan in place for managing the lifespan of feature flags. When you add a flag, you must consider when it will be deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature flags should never be reused. There have been high-profile failures as a result of teams reusing a previous flag that they thought was no longer part of the code for a new purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tooling for Release Flag Management\n",
    "The amount of work involved in managing feature flags should not be underestimated. It is critical to consider employing tracking tooling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Which flags exist.\n",
    "Which flags are enabled in which environments, situations, or target customer categories.\n",
    "The plan for when the flags will be used in production.\n",
    "The plan for when the flags will be removed.\n",
    "Using a feature flag management system allows you to get the benefits of feature flags while limiting the danger of incurring excessive technical debt."

    "# Implement Canary Releases and Dark Launching\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explore Canary Releases\n",
    "Canary release originates from the days when miners carried a canary into the coal mines.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canary's aim was to detect the presence of harmful gases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The canary would die far sooner than the miner, allowing them to flee the potentially fatal environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A canary release allows you to uncover possible issues without exposing all of your end consumers to them all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to only inform a small group of people about a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can acquire useful information from this group of people and either continue or rollback by attentively watching what occurs when you enable the functionality (disable the feature).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the canary release exhibits possible performance or scalability issues, you can develop a fix and deploy it in the canary environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the canary release has shown to be reliable, it can be moved to the actual production environment.\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/85cc157be1dfc2c1f000\n",
    "\n",
    "Canary releases may be achieved through the use of combination of feature toggles, traffic routing, and deployment slots.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the new capability enabled, you may route a percentage of traffic to a deployment slot.\n",
    "Using feature toggles, you may target a certain user segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examine Traffic Manager\n",
    "In the previous module, we saw how Deployment slots in Azure Web Apps enable you to swap between two different versions of your application quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want more control over the traffic that flows to your other versions. Deployment slots alone aren't enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "To control traffic in Azure, you can use a component called Azure Traffic Manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Azure Traffic Manager\n",
    "Azure Traffic Manager is a DNS-based traffic load balancer that allows you to distribute traffic to services across global Azure regions in an optimum manner while maintaining high availability and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic Manager employs DNS to route client requests to the most appropriate service endpoint depending on traffic routing and endpoint health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traffic Manager is resistant to failure, even if an entire Azure region fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the available options may vary over time, the Traffic Manager presently offers six options for traffic distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Priority: Choose this option if you wish to use a primary service endpoint for all traffic and offer backups if either the primary or backup endpoints are unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted: Choose Weighted if you wish to distribute traffic among a collection of endpoints evenly or based on weights that you establish.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance: When you have endpoints in different geographic locations and want end users to use the \"closest\" endpoint for the lowest network latency, go for Performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Geographic: Select Geographic to lead users to certain endpoints (Azure, External, or Nested) based on the geographic location of their DNS query. It enables Traffic Manager customers to allow scenarios in which knowing a user's geographic area and routing them accordingly is required. Following data sovereignty rules, localizing content and user experience, and tracking traffic from multiple locations are some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MultiValue: Choose this option for Traffic Manager profiles that can only contain IPv4/IPv6 addresses as endpoints. When a query for this profile is received, all healthy endpoints are returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Subnet: Use the Subnet traffic-routing method to map groups of end-user IP address ranges to a single endpoint in a Traffic Manager profile. When a request is received, the endpoint provided will be mapped to the request's originating IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the options provided by the Traffic Manager, the most commonly utilized option for Continuous Delivery is traffic routing based on weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Controlling your Canary Release\n",
    "You may establish total control over the traffic flow and enable your canary release using a mix of feature toggles, deployment slots, and Traffic Manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "You deploy the new feature to a new deployment slot or application instance, and then you activate it after ensuring that the deployment was successful.\n",
    "\n",
    "The traffic is then dispersed to a tiny fraction of the users.\n",

    "You carefully monitor the application's behavior, for example, by utilizing application insights to monitor the application's performance and stability.\n",

    "## Understand Dark Launching\n",
    "In many aspects, dark launching is similar to canary releases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction here is that you're aiming to examine users' reactions to new additions in your frontend rather of assessing the backend's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion is that instead of releasing a new feature to all users, you release it to a select group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, these individuals are unaware that they are being utilized as test users for the new feature, and you may not even mention the new feature to them, hence the name \"Dark\" launching.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of dark launching is introducing a new feature and then utilizing it to collect analytics on the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me use a real-world \"launch\" as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SpaceX, as Elon Musk outlines in his biography, employs a variety of Agile development methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "SpaceX manufactures and launches rockets used to launch satellites. Dark launching is also used by SpaceX.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a new version of a sensor becomes available, it is installed alongside the old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data is measured and collected by both the old and new sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "They then compare the results of both sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only when the new sensor produces the same or better results as the old one is the old sensor replaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same principle applies to software. All data and computations are processed through your new feature, but it is not yet \"visible.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Implement Dark Launching\n",
    "Dark launching is essentially the same as a canary release or the implementation and flipping of a feature toggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature is released and only available at a specific period.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, the strategies discussed in earlier chapters also apply to dark launching.\n",

    "Implement A/B Testing and Progressive Exposure Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is A/B Testing?\n",
    "A/B testing (also known as split testing or bucket testing) compares two versions of a web page or app to see which one performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is primarily an experiment in which two or more page versions are randomly given to users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical analysis is also utilized to evaluate which variation performs best for a certain conversion target.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A/B testing is neither a component of or a prerequisite for continuous delivery. It's actually the opposite way around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous delivery enables you to swiftly release MVPs to a production environment and end customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experimenting with new features, generally to see whether they boost conversion rates, is a common goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiments are ongoing, and the impact of change is quantified.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course does not include A/B testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, because it is a powerful idea made possible by adopting continuous delivery, it is noted here for future exploration.\n",

    "Explore CI-CD with Deployment Rings\n",
    "Progressive exposure deployment, often known as ring-based deployment, was introduced in Jez Humble's book Continuous Delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "They help to promote the production-first DevOps philosophy by minimizing the effect on end users while gradually delivering and verifying changes in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact (also known as blast radius) is assessed by observation, testing, telemetry analysis, and user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rings are commonly represented as phases in DevOps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, rings are an extension of the canary stage. The canary release is sent to a stage to be measured. Adding another ring accomplishes the same effect.\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/7217157be4a7a101f000\n",
    "\n",
    "With a ring-based deployment, you start with risk-tolerant clients and gradually expand to a larger group of consumers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These rings are used by the Microsoft Windows team, for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://cdn.hamoye.com/2797157be49b9141f000\n",
    "You must describe your configuration once you have identified several groups of users and see the advantage in investing in a ring-based deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple deployment slots are set up as rings in some companies that employ canary releasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first release of the functionality to ring 0 is aimed towards a well-known group of users, mostly inside their own company.\n",
    "\n",
    "They propagate the release to the next ring when everything has been proved stable in ring 0. It is only with a small number of users outside of their corporation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function is made available to the whole public. It is frequently accomplished by flicking a switch on the software's feature toggles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and health checks, like with the other deployment methods, are critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise - Ring-based Deployment\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "Let's take a look at how ring-based deployments may be used to stage features in a release process.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I develop a new feature, I may want to test it on a small number of people initially, just in case something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "In authenticated systems, I could achieve that by adding those users to a security group and allowing members of that group to utilize the additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a public website, however, I may not have logged-in users. Instead, I may divert a tiny portion of the visitors to the new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how that's set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we slowly release a new feature, we'll develop a new release pipeline that isn't triggered by code changes but is done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that a new feature has already been delivered to the Green site (that is, the staging slot).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click Pipelines, then Release, +New, and then New release pipeline in the PU Hosted project's main menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When prompted to choose a template, pick Empty job from the pane's top menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Rename the Stage 1 stage to Ring 0 by clicking on it (Canary).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hover over the New release pipeline name at the top of the screen, then click the pencil to modify the pipeline name to Ring-based Deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Select the Ring 0 (Canary) stage from the Tasks drop-down list. Hover over Azure CLI from the list of tasks, and when the Add button appears, click it, then click to choose the Azure CLI task in the task list for the stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Select your Azure subscription in the Azure CLI settings window, then set Script Location to Inline script, set the Inline Script to the following, and then click Save and OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "Az webapp traffic-routing set --resource-group $(ResourceGroupName) --name $(WebsiteName) --distribution staging=10\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution will result in 10% of online traffic being sent to the new feature Site (that is, currently the staging slot).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Click Variables from the menu above the task list. As demonstrated, create two new variables. (Please provide your accurate website name.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. To return to editing the pipeline, select Pipeline from the menu above the variables. When the Clone symbol appears, hover over the Ring 0 (Canary) stage and click it. Choose the new stage and rename it Ring 1. (Early Adopters).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Select the Azure CLI task and the Ring 1 (Early Adopters) stage from the Tasks drop-down list. Change the value of 10 to 30 in the script to direct 30% of the visitors to the new feature site.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10. To return to modifying the release pipeline, click Pipeline from the menu above the tasks. Hover your mouse over the Ring 1 (Early Adopters) stage and click the Clone symbol when it appears. Choose the new stage and rename it Public. Click OK and then Save.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Add yourself as a pre-deployment approver by clicking the Pre-deployment conditions icon for the Ring 1 (Early Adopters) stage. Repeat for the Public stage, then click Save and OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in terms of releasing the new code available to the public is to swap the new feature site (that is, the staging site) with the production site, so that production now runs the new code.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Select the Public stage from the Tasks drop-down list. Select the Azure CLI job, change the Display name to Swap sites, and update the Inline Script to:\n",
    "\n",
    "az webapp deployment slot swap -g $(ResourceGroupName) -n $(WebsiteName) --slot staging --target-slot production\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "az webapp deployment slot swap -g $(ResourceGroupName) -n $(WebsiteName) --slot staging --target-slot production\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we must clear all traffic from the staging area.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Clone tasks by right-clicking the Swap sites task (s). Change the Display name of the Swap sites copy job to Stop staging traffic, and update the Inline Script to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "az webapp traffic-routing set --resource-group $(ResourceGroupName) --name $(WebsiteName) --distribution staging=0\n",
    "\n",
    "14. To save your work, click Save then OK.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. To begin a release, click Create release and Create. To view the progress, click the release link.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Wait until Ring 0 (Canary) has succeeded. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At this time, the new feature site will receive 10% of all visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. On the Ring 1 (Early Adopters) stage, click Approve, and then Approve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this stage is completed, 30 percent of the traffic will be directed to the ring 1 early adopters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "17. On the Public stage, click Approve, and then Approve.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this step is finished, all traffic will be sent to the newly switched production site, which will be running the new code.\n",
