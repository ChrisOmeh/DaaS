=====NICE ACTIMIZE ISSUES========

Identify the long running queries.  It can also happen with long running queries , when socket timeout is less than the query time

 I also found that running off our wireless network maintained the connection, where wired did not (and both run through different routes/firewalls)
 
 Resource wait metrics is pointing to network ASYNC_NETWORK_IO which means that 
 Active Expensive queries on SAM_PRF
 
This wait type indicates that sessions must wait for the client application to process the data received 
from SQL Server before the client application can send signal to SQL Server that it can accept new data for processing. 
This kind of experince may reflect a lag in the application design. This is the possible cause of resource wait pointing to 
ASYNC_NETWORK_IO wait type.

As we have previously stated, there are a long running queries identified in SAM_PRF. Long running queries can lead to intermittent connection
failure especially when it is tend to cause lock to other sessions.
 
Finally, we would like to confirm that you are running this on UAT environment. This is because a section of your mail said your didn't experience 
this issue when you were on UAT.
 Network performace.

 Hello @Donald Cameron

Thanks for the feedback.

The activities on the server and databases was carefully examined especially at time when the job was initiated. Our findings indicated 
there is no server or database related issue that could trigger a connection failure that was referring/poining to ODBC. When connection failure is experienced regarding ODBC, it could be due to the following:

•	Network related issue regarding that connection. We checked and observed a resource wait that is pointing to ASYNC_NETWORK_IO wait type. This waits type indicates that sessions must wait for the client application to process the data received from SQL Server before the client 
	application can send signal to SQL Server that it can accept new data for processing. This kind of experience may reflect a lag in the application design. This is the possible cause of resource wait pointing to ASYNC_NETWORK_IO wait type.

•	As we have previously stated, long running queries identified in SAM_PRF could also lead to connection timeout if there is no response gotten. 
	Long running queries can lead to intermittent connection failure especially when it tends to cause lock to other sessions.

FINDINGS
10.208.26.82 on port 80 is having highest latency value.
Server have 64GB memory, can it be increased?
Can the database drives be increased?
3GB free memory and 55+GB in use.

recommendation
Let addition hardware resources be provided for the. More Disk space and memory
Let just replicate the exact resource usage of Actimize in prod in UAT(10.234.200.227)
