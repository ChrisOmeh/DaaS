NETWORKING IN DEVOPS
BY ESE ATAIDE

What is networking?
Communication between two or more computer and associated devices.

Transmission Media are used to transfer files from one medium to another.
Sharded Cables
ALl PEOPLE SEEM TO NEED DATA PROCESSING networking model

If two or mpre ips are in different network but same subnet, can they commnunicate by default? If yes can i set a firewal rule to stop the 
communication?

Each octex has 8 bits. 128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1
There mainly Class A, Class B, Class C IP Addresses.

Identifying Subnet, Network and Host
If the value is in the range 1 to 127, the address belongs to class A. 
If the value is in the range 128 to 191, the address belongs to class B.
If the value is in the range 192 to 223, the address belongs to class C.
If the value is in the range 224 to 239, the address belongs to class D.

============
If the value is in the range 1 to 127, the address belongs to class A.
If the value is in the range 128 to 191, the address belongs to class B.
If the value is in the range 192 to 223, the address belongs to class C.
If the value is in the range 224 to 239, the address belongs to class D.
If the value is in the range 240 to 255, the address belongs to class E.

ONES WILL GIVE MORE SUBNETS WHILE MORE ZEROES WILL GIVE MORE Host
subnet = 2 power network n here is ones
host = 2 power n - 2  n here is zeros

BROADCAST IP ADDRESS IS WHERE ALL THE BITS ARE TURNED ON I.E 1, 255
WHILE NETWORK IP ADIS WHERE BIT ARE TURNED OFF I.E 0, 0

Example
Netword = 172.43.1.0
first ip =172.43.1.1
last ip = 172.43.1.2
broadcast ip = 172.43.1.3


NOTES
--IPV4 is made up of 32 bit logical address
--The 32 bits are divided into four octets of 8 bits i.e 1byte per octets
--The octets are separated by a DOT notation.
--Network Bit is denoted by ONE(1) while the Host Bit is denoted by ZERO(0)
--In Class A IP Address, the first Octet is for NETWORK i.e NETWORK ADDRESS/8 BIT
--In Class B IP Address, the first and second octet are for the NETWORK i.e NETWORK 16 BIT
--In Class C IP Address, the first, second and third octet are for the NETWORK i.e NETWORK 24 BIT

STEPS 
-Use ip address and its subnet mask to determine the ip class
-Use ip address and its subnet mask to determine the CIDR 
-Use CIDR to determine the NETWORK ADDRESS.
